  Netflix Clone Built Using React.JS & Axios
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a clone of Netflix website built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong> as a Front-end . It's not a replica, and it     doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced       like Netflix. It contains the home page which has list all the different type of category shows & movies netflix has.
